## Release intelligence for modern DevOps

**Relicta** is an AI-native release intelligence engine that analyzes the impact of code changes, predicts blast radius, and enables safe, policy-driven releases.

Traditional release tooling relies on brittle commit conventions and blind automation.  
Relicta understands **what a change means**, **what it affects**, and **when it is safe to ship**.

---

### What Relicta does

- 🧠 **Semantic change analysis**  
  Understands intent and impact from code diffs, not just commit messages.

- 📡 **Blast radius detection**  
  Identifies downstream services, packages, and teams affected by a release.

- 🛡 **Policy-based automation**  
  Safely auto-approve low-risk releases while blocking high-risk ones.

- 🤝 **Human-in-the-loop by default**  
  Transparent plans and approvals via an interactive terminal UI.

- 🔌 **MCP-first architecture**  
  Grounded AI reasoning using real system context (Git, Jira, CI, monorepos).

### Philosophy

> *Automate releases — not trust.*

Relicta is built for teams that want speed **and** confidence, automation **and** control.
